So far, we have seen that networks with two teams give rise to 2 phenotypes majorly, and additional phenotypes with very less frequency. In EMP, the hybrid phenotype is observed to have characteristics of both epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes, which can be explained by the two teams model. However, recent studies, many from our lab, suggest that there are genes that stabilize the hybrid phenotypes, suggesting that there might be a third team that supports the hybrid phenotypes (remember that teams did not stabilize the hybrid phenotypes). The aim of this project, therefore, is to explore the differences in stability of the hybrid states obtained from two teams and those obtained from networks with three teams. We will try out different configurations of the three teams, namely third inhibiting the E and M teams, third team activating E team and inhibiting M team and vice versa. Using the results we thus obtain, our aim would be to identify the conditions required to have a team supporting hybrid state such that the hybrid states are weaker than epithelial and mesenchymal states.
